			<Text>Great People are the artists, merchants, engineers, scientists, generals, or admirals who can, single-handedly, change the course of a civilization. In Civilization VI, each Great Person is an individual with their own name and effect based on their historical influence. There are seven types of Great People: Great Artists (or Writers or Musicians), Great Engineers, Great Merchants, Great Scientists, Great Prophets, Great Admirals, and Great Generals.</Text>

			<Text>Born in Jhang in January 1926, Abdus Salam would become of the first Pakistani and the first Muslim to win a Nobel Prize for science, specifically in theoretical physics. His father was an official for the Department of Education of the Punjab State, so he didn’t go to bed hungry; and his family had a long tradition as religious scholars, and so were respected. When Abdus cycled home from Lahore at the age of 14, having gained the highest marks ever recorded for entrance to the University of the Punjab, the entire village turned out to congratulate him.</Text>

			<Text>Returning to Pakistan in 1951, taking up the post of head of the Mathematics Department at Punjab University, intending to found a school for research, Salam soon realized what other young geniuses had – his hometown just didn’t have the opportunities available elsewhere. In 1954 he accepted a lectureship at Cambridge, but visited his native land often as an advisor on science policy; from 1961 to 1971, he was Chief Scientific Advisor to the President of Pakistan. And for 40 years he was a prolific researcher and writer in theoretical elementary particle physics, culminating with a shared Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for his work on electroweak unification. Throughout, Abdus remained a devout Muslim – married twice and father of six – until he died in November 1996.</Text>

			<Text>Around 936 AD, Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas al-Zahrawi was born in the town of El-Zahra, a few miles northwest of Cordoba, in Islamic al-Andalus. Under the Umayyad Caliphate, it was a golden age of learning and stability, al-Andalus a place where Muslims, Jews, and Christians lived in harmony, scientific advances were made without fear, and prosperity and tolerance was the rule rather than the exception. It was the ideal environment for the greatest surgeon in civilization to flourish.</Text>

Unlike doctors today, al-Zahrawi insisted on seeing all who came as patients, regardless of their financial status – a quirk the caliph allowed him to indulge. Thus, al-Zahrawi saw a variety of illnesses and injuries, could experiment with treatments, and could record in meticulous detail his observations. Towards the end of his life, he compiled these into a 30-volume encyclopedia of medicine, the 'Al-Tasrif li man ajaz an-il-talif' (“An Aid for Those Who Lack the Capacity to Read Big Books”).</Text>

			<Text>The only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron (who abandoned his wife a month after the birth), Ada Lovelace began a lifelong friendship with Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at Cambridge, in 1833 AD, when she was but 17 years old. Their relationship seems to have been a platonic one, for they soon commenced a voluminous correspondence on mathematics, logic, and all manner of scholarly topics. In 1835 Ada married William King, ten years her senior and soon Earl of Lovelace. She would bear three children.</Text>

			<Text>Her only other significant contribution to civilization resulted from her efforts as a translator for Babbage. By 1834 Babbage had devised a new design for his “Difference Engine,” a mechanical calculator for polynomial functions. But Parliament refused to sink any money into this second design, the “Analytical Engine,” and Babbage turned to foreign investors. In 1842, the Italian Louis Menebrea published a tract in French on the Analytical Engine, and Babbage recruited Ada to translate it for him. Over a nine-month period, she worked at this task, and appended a series of detailed notes to it … longer than the memoir itself. Among this extensive annotation, she devised a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers using the machine. On the basis of this, some historians of science consider her to be the first “computer programmer.”</Text>

His father was a judge advocate and comptroller of customs in Kirkcaldy (so perhaps money was in Adam’s blood if not his pocket), but died two months after the birth of his son. Adam attended the Burgh School in the town, where he learned Latin, mathematics, history, literature, and so forth.

Now a Doctor of Law, in 1766 Smith returned to Kirkcaldy and spent the next decade writing his magnum opus in relative obscurity … at least until it was published in 1776. It was an instant success, the first printing of 'An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations' sold out in just six months.

But they regularly prayed at the nearby Vadakkunnathan temple in Trichur. Shiva appeared to the couple in a dream and promised them a choice – either one son who would be short-lived but the most brilliant philosopher of the age, or many sons who would each lead mediocre lives.

			<Text>Since there are 14 different historical biographies of his life, it is rather challenging to sort out fact from fiction, but all agree Shankara was a holy Hindu. Even as a child he displayed a penchant towards spiritual insight, could recite the Puranas, and mastered the Vedas. Adi believed whole-heartedly in the Vedas simultaneously disputed the need for over-exaggerated associated rituals and religious practices. As a teen, he therefore asked his mother – his father being dead – for permission to renounce the world and travel south in search of a guru. Thus he met one Govinda Bhagavatpada, who helped Shankara master various forms of yoga that included Hatha, Raja and Jnana. Adi vowed to spread the teachings of Brahma Sutras across the world (or as much of it as he could reach).</Text>

According to some, on the journey to her wedding, her party was attacked by Danes – perhaps hoping to prevent an alliance between Wessex and Mercia – but the lady directed her escort into an old trench and so fought off the attackers. Within a few years, Æthelred and Æthelflæd had their first and only child (Ælfwynn); it appears that fighting off the Vikings … who had already overrun portions of Mercia … left them little time for other activities. By 884 Æthelflæd had joined her husband in directing the campaign, spending much of her time overseeing the rebuilding of crumbling Roman strongholds and the fortifying of towns as Anglo-Saxon forces recaptured Danish-held territories. According to legend, she also was the prime architect of Saxon strategy.</Text>

This was one of many battles in which Æthelred was not involved; he had been ill since around 902, and after ten years of battling poor health finally died. At this point Æthelflæd became the sole ruler of Mercia, and thus “Lady of Mercia.” Æthelflæd immediately turned to her brother Edward (the Elder, who had succeeded Alfred in 899) for support, and together they continued the campaign to drive the Danes out and unify the various English kingdoms. While Wessex acquired London and Oxford, she led campaigns in Wales in 916 and 917, and liberated Derby and Leicester to the north in 918. But on her way to York to accept its pledge of fealty, she died, likely succumbing to one of the now-trivial diseases of the time.</Text>

Following the rise of the Taliban in 1996 Massoud, who initially was willing to work with it to provide stability to the nation but eventually rejected its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, returned to armed opposition, forming the “United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan.” For his troubles he was assassinated on September 9, probably at the instigation of al-Qaeda, two days before the 2001 attacks in the United States.</Text>

Attacks on the enemy infrastructure brought reprisals and six bloody Soviet offensives into the Panjshir. When the Russians finally withdrew from the morass, Afghanistan collapsed into civil war. At first, Massoud sought to include the extremist Taliban, backed by Pakistan, hoping it would help provide added stability in the peace process … but soon he was again leading a resistance movement in the mountains. By this point, he had become an international spokesman for Afghani aspirations of freedom; thus, at the age of 48, Ahmad Massoud became the target of a suicide attack.</Text>

Rublev never left, for all of his paintings – religious frescos and icons – are found in the vicinity of Moscow. The first actual record of him is in 1405 when he executed a number of panel paintings for the Blagoveschenski Sobor (Cathedral of the Annunciation) in the Moscow Kremlin.

The only work truly authenticated, however, is the famed Trinity icon completed around 1410. Many of his works – such as the Deesis – were likely destroyed in the great Moscow fire in 1547. His style, marked by a sense of asceticism and harmony, was pronounced a model for church painting at the Stoglayi Synod in 1551.

Growing up in Fredericksburg on the arid plains of central Texas, CWN looked to a military career to escape the drudgery and tedium. As a teenager (born in 1885 AD) he had sought to apply for admittance to West Point but there were no openings; so he took the entrance exam to the Naval Academy as consolation, with scores so outstanding he entered in 1901.

That same year Sancho launched a campaign to seize his brother Alfonso VI’s kingdom of Leon. Although legend would depict El Cid (the name given him by the Moors after Zaragoza) a reluctant supporter of the aggression, it is unlikely he had any real scruples and he certainly distinguished himself in the ensuing war. But when Sancho was killed besieging Zamora, El Cid quickly changed his allegiance, and married Alfonso’s niece to boot.</Text>

Offering his services to the Muslim rulers of Zaragoza, he loyally served the caliph and his successor for a decade against Lérida and its Christian allies, notably Barcelona and Aragon. Come 1086 and the great Almoravid invasion from North Africa, Alfonso swallowed his ire and recalled El Cid. When the 18-month siege of Valencia finally ended in 1094, El Cid entered it as conqueror, had the former ruler burnt alive, and brought in a French bishop. He ruled there even-handed, favoring neither Christian nor Muslim, until his death in 1099.</Text>

			<Text>Fitzgerald had tapped into the zeitgeist of the Jazz Age with his novels, of which The Great Gatsby is considered the most exemplary. His heroes and heroines are socialites, young, idealists, devoted to leisure. There is a sense of imminent catastrophe about them, of imminent disillusion, and a mortal fear of aging out of the moment of beauty. The specter of the just-finished War to End All Wars looms, having laid waste to the old order and old moralities, but there is often no real sense of what is to follow. In many ways, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald's life paralleled these themes. The couple were celebrities and fixtures of the social scene, and Scott Fitzgerald's drinking (and its consequences) was often as widely and hotly discussed as the stories he wrote. Fitzgerald wrote and drank, fought with Zelda and drank, published stories and articles in magazines and drank, and moved to Europe and drank. As the Jazz age waned, Zelda Fitzgerald's mental health deteriorated, and she was institutionalized for the rest of her life. Scott Fitzgerald eventually moved to Hollywood and earned a living as a screenwriter to pay down his enormous debts. He died in relative obscurity in 1940, only 44 years old.</Text>

To pass the time and give her romantic notions free rein, Jane began writing stories – eventually novels – in a series of notebooks in the mid-1890s. They were, in effect, witty parodies of the romantic claptrap of the day. These bits and pieces would evolve into more ambitious works: the great 'Sense &amp; Sensibility,' 'Pride &amp; Prejudice,' and 'Northanger Abbey.' With the help of her brother Henry, who convinced the printer and bookseller Thomas Edgerton to publish it, 'Sense' would be released in 1811 – anonymously but to acclaim for its social commentary.</Text>

In 1917, he began writing essays on controversial topics such as Czech nationalism, foreign totalitarianism, and rampant consumerism. Soon, however, he turned from essays to fiction. Almost all of Čapek's literary works are inquiries into philosophical conundrums; his first batch of short stories are concerned with man’s efforts to break the pattern of destiny and grasp “ultimate” values.</Text>

At 14, the boy was apprenticed to a wood-carver, and at 18 he was accepted into the studio of the artist Katsukawa Shunsho. Shunsho practiced ukiyo-e, wood-block printing and painting.

In 1800 Katsushika  – the name he is best known by – published two collections of prints: Famous Sights of the Eastern Capital and Eight Views of Edo. By 1834, under the name Gakyo Rojin Manji (“the old man mad about art”), the workaholic was producing hundreds of prints a year … more than 30000 by the time he died in April 1849.</Text>

In 60 BC Crassus joined Pompey and young Julius Caesar in forming the so-called First Triumvirate to rule Rome. Whether it was jealousy of Caesar and Pompey or simply greed, Marcus Crassus managed to get the Senate to appoint him governor of the rich province of Syria. Not satisfied plundering Syria, he embarked on an ill-advised invasion of Parthia, where he was killed at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC.

In 1642 she was sent by the family – perhaps hoping to nip this thinking thing in the bud – to live with her sister in Oxford, where the royal court happened to be in residence. Seeking an independent life, Margaret applied, and was accepted, to be a maid of honor to Queen Henrietta Maria, accompanying her mistress into exile in Paris in 1644 at the height of the first English Civil War.</Text>

Her marriage to the duke is noteworthy for two reasons. First, at a time when it just wasn’t done to print the writings of a woman, most of hers saw publication due to her well-connected husband.

Many salons of that time were writing stories about fairies, or the intersection of normal people's lives and the world of magic, drawing on inspiration from both the courtly and folk literature of the middle ages and Renaissance. Her tales play with the conventions of the genre (wicked stepmothers abound, wolves of the two- and four-legged variety threaten young heroines, and occasionally a prince sheds his disguise at an opportune moment,) but hers are remarkable for the richness of their setting. Minor characters' and villains' motivations are often explained in great detail. The agenda of the helpful fairies do not always correspond with those of the humans they help. She published two books of these fairy tales: Les Contes de Fees (The Tales of the Fairies)  and Contes Nouveaux ou Les Fees a la Mode (New Tales, or Fairies of Fashion). D'Aulnoy also wrote extensively on historical matters, and she earned the nickname "Clio" after the muse of history for these efforts.

Someone else in that group wrote a story about a lady whose head was a skull and who peeked through key-holes. They tried their best, no doubt. Frankenstein's place in the canon of literature is undisputed. It is heralded as the first English-language science fiction novel. It explores psychological horror and the interconnection of self-destruction and the fear of creation's power.

			<Text>Gampo became king of Tibet at the age of 13 when his father Namri was assassinated. To maintain the unity of Tibet and deflect the various plots against the Songsten dynasty, he would spend most of his life crisscrossing the country with his army. While he may well have been the earthly manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, it didn’t do him much good – although he did have six consorts (three that he married), so that may have been some consolation. Seeking allies, in 639 AD he married the Princess Chizun from Nepal and in 641 the Princess Wencheng of the Tang dynasty. According to the chronicles, the Nepalese and Chinese princesses were devout Buddhists (they would later both be deified as incarnations of the goddess Tara), and so converted Songsten Gampo to that faith … and he promptly converted his people (those who knew what was good for themselves). When catastrophic floods devastated the Yarlung valley, they convinced the king to make holy Lhasa his new capital and there build the Potala Palace.</Text>

Next, thwarted by Songzhou, he launched a brief attack on it but finally retreated and apologized. Another war with Zhangzhung ensued, in which its king was ambushed and killed by Gampo’s soldiers around 645. Then came Gampo’s defeat of the Tanguts. Finally, in a dispute with his younger brother Tsensong, he had his sibling burnt to death. A few years later, in 650, Songsten Gampo died of an unknown illness.</Text>

Almost certainly the accepted version incorporates commentary from later philosophers such as Li Quan and Du Mu. Whatever the case, the approach to military strategy therein is an implicitly Taoist one. Unlike Western thinkers, Sun Tzu argues that “force” (li) is not the center of military strategy; instead, victory and defeat are psychological states.

After passing examinations, he entered into military service to the Joseon dynasty in 1576. Although discharged a couple of times for misconduct, in 1591 he was appointed commander of the naval forces in the port of Yeosu; there he concentrated on training recruits, stockpiling munitions, and designing the kobukson (“turtle ship”). The kobukson was the first ironclad in civilization, its upper deck covered in armored plates, armed with cannons, with smoke pots to obscure the ship. Just in time for the Japanese invasions that commenced in 1592.</Text>

			<Text>In four brilliant operations over the course of that year, Yi Sun-Sin’s forces – spearheaded by turtle ships – won fifteen battles and sank hundreds of the flimsy Japanese ships. In recognition, Yi was given command of the combined naval forces of three southern provinces – Jeolla, Gyeongsang and Chungcheong. But following peace negotiations, he was again accused of disloyalty and thus demoted to the rank of common sailor. But when the Japanese launched a second invasion and quickly destroyed most of the Korean fleet, he was promptly restored to his command.</Text>

			<Text>Things looked dire for Korea as the Japanese landed, supported by a massive combined fleet of some 300 ships (at least 133 of these warships). Yi managed to gather 13 Korean ships – a mix of panokseon and kobukson – and maneuvered such as to lead the overconfident Japanese into a narrow strait. In the ensuing battle of Myeongnyang in October 1597, the Japanese lost 31 ships (and the commanding Japanese admiral was killed aboard his flagship) while Yi suffered only 13 casualties. But a year later, in December 1598 after Yi Sun-Sin had defeated yet another massive Japanese fleet, he was killed by a bullet during the pursuit.</Text>

			<Text>Around 138 BC, Zhang Qian rode through the tall stone gates of Chang’an, capital of the Han dynasty, headed for the dry and unknown lands to the west of the empire. An officer of the imperial guard, he was at the head a contingent of 100 volunteers. On the northwest border of the Han were the barbarian Xiung-nu (otherwise known in the West as the Huns), a near constant threat. The Han needed allies to curtail the threat, and had heard rumors of the Yueh-chih beyond the Xiung-nu. Unfortunately, Zhang and his delegation were captured by the Huns, and spent the next decade as hostages.</Text>

			<Text>Managing to extricate themselves from this unpleasantness, Zhang and some of his people crossed the Gobi and passed over the snow-capped Pamirs. They reached the Yueh-chih, who however had no interest in an alliance since the Xiung-nu didn’t bother them (much). So Zhang continued to wander, as far as northern India, and found a surprising number of peaceful and prosperous lands civilized people. The wealth and goods of these lands, not only their jade but agricultural products such as grapes and wine (unknown in China) and powerful horses, excited him. Moreover, these kingdoms proved quite interested in the Chinese trade goods, particularly the silk.</Text>

			<Text>After further adventures, Zhang, his wife and son, and one other companion managed to return to Chang’an, 13 years after setting out. Although he had failed in his mission, Zhang's tales of the western lands and the potential for trade stirred the mercenary hearts of the Chinese. In short order the Han emperors sent forces to drive the barbarians away and open a route to the west, establishing garrisons to protect what would come to be known as the Silk Road, the richest trade route of history.</Text>

			<Text>The greatest seafarer in 4000 years of Chinese civilization was born c. 1371 AD and raised in the mountainous heart of Asia, hundreds of miles from the nearest port. Moreover, Zheng He wasn’t Chinese, but the son of a minor, Muslim official – the boy’s birth name was Ma Sanbao – in the Mongol province of Yunnan taken captive by an invading Ming army in 1382. Ritually castrated, he was trained as an imperial eunuch and assigned to the court of Zhu Di, the bellicose prince of Yan.</Text>

			<Text>By 1390, the renamed Zheng had distinguished himself as a junior officer, skilled at both war and diplomacy, for the prince. The young eunuch became a trusted advisor to Zhu Di and in 1400 when the prince revolted, Zheng served him brilliantly. Defeating the Jianwen emperor in 1402, the prince of Yan established the Yongle line of the Ming dynasty. Seeking to spread Chinese influence, jumpstart the economy, and distract the restless nobles, the new emperor selected Zheng He to outfit and lead a series of missions to the “Western Oceans.”</Text>

			<Text>Zheng set sail on his first voyage of exploration in 1405, in command of 62 ships; his fleet sailed south, visiting Champa, Siam, Malacca, Java and then west across the Indian Ocean to Calicut and Ceylon. Three more voyages followed in rapid succession, as his ships reached the Arabian coast and sailed down the African. A fifth voyage brought back envoys to the Ming court from 30 kingdoms, and a sixth voyage in 1421 returned them home. Zheng He’s final voyage departed in the winter of 1431, again sailing along Southeast Asia, to the coast of India, into the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, along the coast of Africa. But on the return Zheng He died in Calicut in the spring of 1433.</Text>

			<Text>Born of a “priestly family,” a direct descendant in the royal line of Manushcihar, upon his birth Zoroaster supposedly laughed instead of crying when the god Ahura Mazda descended from heaven to greet him. His message was simple: lead a moral life that would pave the way for eternal bliss … and follow the monotheistic doctrines of the God of Righteousness, Ahura Mazda.</Text>

			<Text>At the age of 16, Zoroaster was already indifferent to all worldly pleasures … miraculous among teenagers. At the age of 20 he left his home to lead a life of poverty and virtue, wandering about preaching not just in the cities of ancient Iran but the forests and mountains as well. Spending a lot of time in meditation and reflection, on the summit of Mount Sabatam he experienced communion with his god and enjoyed (or perhaps suffered) seven divine, prophetic visions. For the rest of his life, Zoroaster would have conversations with the “Beneficent Immortals” (archangels). And he conquered Ahriman, the Satan of Zoroastrianism. And composed the Gathas, 17 hymns that expounding the divine essences. All this around 600 BC, according to writers such as Plutarch and Diogenes.</Text>

			<Text>Zoroaster also took on the followers of various cults, the Kavis and the Karpan. Their priests turned Vishtasp, the king of Iran, against Zoroaster. But when the latter did not die of starvation in prison – despite not being fed – due to the intercession of his god, the king saw the light. Even more so when the prophet saved the life of the king’s much-beloved black horse. The conversion of the royal family set off a war with the nearby kingdom of Turan, lasting several years. In the process, Zoroaster was killed by one Bratrok-resh, a Turanian, while praying in the Fire Temple at Nush-Adar.</Text>
