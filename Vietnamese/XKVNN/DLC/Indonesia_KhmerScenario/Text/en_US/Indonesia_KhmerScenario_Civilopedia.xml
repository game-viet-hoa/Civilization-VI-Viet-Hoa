Meanwhile, in the far-flung mountains and villages, practitioners of ancient, indigenous faiths were allowed to conduct their rituals without interruption (without being seen as threats to the state religion). In this way, the king avoided any pesky conflicts with local rulers who might have been anxious about their new leaders looking to replace their gods.</Text>

			<Text>"Guru" is a Sanskrit term that denotes a master and teacher in a given field, typically religion and its instruction. Gurus are important in Hinduism, Jainism, some branches of Buddhism, and most especially in Sikhism, whose founder is Guru Nanak. A proper relationship between the guru and student is considered critical guiding students in these religions, though the methods by which the guru instructs the student vary between traditions. But all these make clear the guru is more than just a teacher, but a font of spiritual wisdom and sacred instruction.</Text>

			<Text>A monk is a religious practitioner who has renounced the secular world in order to live an ascetic life of prayer and spiritual devotion. Many religious traditions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and Jainism, have monastic traditions as part of their faith. Some monastic orders withdraw almost entirely from the world, while others are renowned for their service to the community around them. Monks often wear special clothing indicating their separation from worldly affairs.</Text>

			<Text>A priest is a religious leader, often one who has undergone special preparation for their role.  The term is derived from the Latin "presbyter," meaning "elder," but is generally recognized to encompass the role played in many religions today and throughout history. The job of priest may be one of the oldest human occupations, appearing in the archaeological and cultural record almost contemporaneously with the development of agriculture. Priests are called upon to serve as intermediaries between people and their deity, offer sacrifice, and provide rituals marking critical life events. A priest may observe special obligations and restrictions as part of their role, or receive their title in addition to their role in society.</Text>

			<Text>A missionary is a person who feels called to spread their religion and convert non-believers to it. This process is called proselytization, and may be accompanied by charitable works on behalf of the prospective believers--or more forceful methods. Missionaries may be anointed religious, such as priests, or dedicated lay persons in the faith. Missionaries sometimes provide insight into the pre-contact cultures they reach out to, including documenting beliefs, rituals, and language, although often with the intent of replacing these with their preferred belief.</Text>
