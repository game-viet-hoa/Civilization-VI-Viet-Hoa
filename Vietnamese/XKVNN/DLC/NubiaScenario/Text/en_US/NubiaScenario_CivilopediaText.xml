The false daughter immediately explained the pharaoh's ruse to the Persian king, because getting someone on board with a ridiculous plan is nearly impossible when you have killed their entire family.

The death of Darius II in 404 BCE led to Egypt's revolt, at which point Persia spent decades struggling to regain control over their lost satrapy. Egypt kept the Achaemenids at bay until 343 BCE, when Artaxerxes III arrived with 350,000 seasoned troops and promptly drove the last truly Egyptian dynasty from the country. The Persians would hold onto a relatively stable Egypt for a decade--until the arrival of Alexander the Great.</Text>

			<Text>To the delight of Persian-occupied Egyptians, Alexander the Great invaded Egypt in 332 BCE and claimed it for Macedon. Any lingering resentment was mollified when the oracle at Memphis named him the living son of the god Amun. He left a conquering hero of Macedon's new satrap, with Egypt's riches backing his further conquests to the east. After his death in 322 BCE, Alexander's trusted general Ptolemy took charge of Egyptian affairs. A succession crisis in Alexander's disintegrating empire saw Egypt as a particularly large and self-sustaining fragment--now ruled by the man declaring himself King Ptolemy I Soter.</Text>

The once mighty fusion of Macedon's best and Egypt's millennia-long pharaonic line found itself reduced to a protectorate of the upstart Roman Republic, charged with feeding its many legions. However, the true end of Ptolemaic Egypt died with Cleopatra in 30 BCE.</Text>

When Egypt--the breadbasket of the Mediterranean--faced a particularly difficult loss at the hands of Macedon and the Seleucid Empire, Rome took the opportunity to declare an alliance. As the years passed and Egypt continued to falter, Rome made itself ever more necessary until a vastly weakened Egypt found its own affairs were the concern of Roman puppetmasters.</Text>

			<Text>Egypt saw enough conflict with Libyan tribes to build coastal forts by the 13th Century BCE. Stretching far west of the Nile Delta, the forts could delay any Libyan attack from the west and alert the capital of an invasion. So went the theory. The forts certainly weren't effective in 1208 BCE when the Libu tribe led Libyan troops to attack the Nile Delta itself, along with the aid of the mysterious Sea People. It didn't matter that Egypt swiftly repelled the invasion. A direct incursion into the heart of Egypt was a powerful lesson to the surviving Libyans.</Text>

They assembled their allies, which once more included the Sea People, and invaded in 1181 BCE. Egypt held off the armies and lined the shores of the Nile with archers to pelt Sea People invaders. A 1175 BCE invasion led solely by the Meshwesh brought them to utter defeat, internment, and subsequent incorporation into Egypt.</Text>
